# Import necessary modules
from utils import importData, formatAllMessages, makeWordMapping

# Define function for tokenizing message strings

# Define the Model class
    # Initialize empty untrained model

    # Define Monitor class for monitoring progress during training
        # Initialize class
        # Define method for updating state of monitor
        # Define method for outputting data to file

    # Define training routine

    # Define inference/prediction routine

# Run the script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass
    # Import raw data
    # Convert data into usable format by tokenizing
    # Split into train, validation, and test sets
    # Add multiples of minority class (spam) to training set to balance classes

    # Instantiate model
    # Call training method
    # Save model to file

    # Run inference (do this later, after successful training)
