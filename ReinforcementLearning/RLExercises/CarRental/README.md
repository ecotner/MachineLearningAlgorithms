Solution to exercise 4.5.

Problem: Jack runs two car rental locations, and must determine how to distribute his rental cars between the two locations. He earns $10 for each car rental, and they become available for rental the day after they are returned. It costs him $2 to move cars between each location. The number of cars requested at each location is a Poisson random variable n. To simplify the problem, we assume that each location can hold a maximum number of cars (10), and similarly, only a maximum number can be transferred between each location on a given day (5). [The plots of the value function and policy at each step of the policy iteration algorithm can be found in the Plots1 directory.]

We can then add in some additional reward structure. One of Jackâ€™s employees at the first location rides a bus home each night and lives near the second location. She is happy to shuttle one car to the second location for free. Each additional car still costs $2, as do all cars moved in the other direction. In addition, Jack has limited parking space at each location. If more than 5 cars are kept overnight at a location (after any moving of cars), then an additional cost of $4 must be incurred to use a second parking lot (independent of how many cars are kept there). [The plots of the value function and policy at each step of the policy iteration algorithm for this new environment can be found in the Plots2 directory.]
