Solution to exercise 4.5.

Problem: Jack runs two car rental locations, and must determine how to distribute his rental cars between the two locations. He earns $10 for each car rental, and they become available for rental the day after they are returned. It costs him $2 to move cars between each location. The number of cars requested at each location is a Poisson random variable n. To simplify the problem, we assume that each location can hold a maximum number of cars, and similarly, only a maximum number can be transferred between each location on a given day.
